# Facial-Recognition

Identifying faces of individuals in a class with their label using MATLAB

Individuals were assigned a label and the MATLAB recognisefacefunction identifies the label of an individual when unseen data is passed through it.

<b> Future Work </b>

Introduce OCR to automatically recognise the labels of the individual, right now this is a manual process
Use other algorithms such as YOLO for facial recognition.
